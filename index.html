<h1>Real Book M-RIAT</h1>
<p>The Real Book purpose is to inspire others to get out and tell tales of living life.  While inspiring others may seem like Childs Play for some others may need some inspiration to join the fun.  After logging onto the mobile app together you set your intention and the quantum random number generator will allow you to locate the adventure at a destination nearby.  The story you tell is up to you but we recommend using talk to text or typing it out and even allow for the written word to be left with a contribution from any number of members who want to go on record and develop their following as members of the inspiration community.  A pin will be dropped at that exact location in order to allow other members to view the inspiration history once and only once they have uploaded their respective contributions.  Only contributing members are allowed to see the history of any given location.  
</p>
<p>
    Wrong Ian the only way to make it contagious is to allow for a physical record to be buried or hidden at any potential pin dropped.  The dropping of a pin location and the burying of a physical record of mutual random inspiration action taken is solely up to the discretion of the individuals participating in the document.  We recommend hand written accounts be backed up with typed transcripts or audio transcripts in the form of jump drives which may themselves also contain video documentation supporting the M-RIAT claims.  One of those three must be left and those who want to discourage the use of hand writing analysis may opt for a typed transcript in lieu of authentic original evidence. 
</p>    
    
 <p>   
    To preserve anonymity no names photos or voice recordings will be used unless opted for and the only implementation will use blockchain technology to secure all histories.  
</p>   
<p>
    Once a pin is dropped and evidence is buried the location of the pin is made known to local users in the region through blockchain technology.  
</p>   
<p>
    It will be at the sole discretion of the user or parties who bury the documentation of the mutual record of inspiring action taken whether to mark the later discovery on blockchain for potential upload, never to be uploaded, or to upload a portion of it themselves as a tease for future M-RIAT treasure hunters to fuel their M-RIAT hunting motivations.  This also puts the users on the blockchain in a more permanent way and allows the location to gain a following of itâ€™s own early on in the process.  
</p>  
<p>
    The potential future discoverers are immediately given access to chat with the original authors who buried the M-RIAT evidence, should they want to collaborate with them in growing the archive and spreading it around to other locations symbolic of their mutual intentions.  
</p>    
<p>
    The founders of Real Book also encourage the discoverer to immediately celebrate if alone at the site of discovery by initiating more M-RIAT behavior with any nearby acquaintances who agree to download the blockchain app and contribute based on the local evidence in addition to everything else that may have ever happened at that site combined with the life histories of the concerned parties.
</p>   
<p> 
    In the event that new M-RIAT documenting evidence results from such encounters the participants are given the option the credit the original find or tag other sources of evidence they sought for inspiration before engaging in the current document or potential future find.  
</p>   
<p>
    There by we create a trail of inspiration that follows us only as long as we allow it to making amendments in real time if certain individuals are found no longer to be inspiring or we no longer wish to associate or tag them in association with our chain of inspiration in the future.
</p>   
<p>
    Due to the peer to peer nature of blockchain technology if the originating party of said inspirational evidence does not consent to being tagged as a contributor then the binding association will not be recorded on the blockchain.  
</p>  
<p>
    As individuals we anticipate disputes in the record of inspiration.  When they arise by two parties in direct contact resolution may be opted for by the community.  Allowing for separate branches or chains of inspiration to spawn that trace their inspiration back to one or the other if not both of the authors, if so agreed by the originating members in said inspirational dispute of irreconcilable differences there may be no option for the reconciling inspiration allowed.  
</p>
<p>
    This encourages people to work together and as individuals who mutually benefit from creating living documentation of relational evidence.
</p>
<p>  
    When a chain of related documents reaches maturity and can truly be called a well developed meme or an idea that has reached closure to the satisfaction of all members involved they may vote and pass it unanimously as measure of closure.  This process may be completed once the parties have submitted a unified perspective on the material as a whole and why it deserves to be counted as a meme potentially after successive attempts at documenting completely one part or another by unique and different members of the chain in association with new individuals.  The purpose would be to help define other streams of inspiration in contrast to their own memetic style.  Allowing future users to identify with and define themselves in the later stages of cultural solidification.  This is useful if a new user or member wishes to found an originating inspirational idea and plant it as evidence of their inspiration for others to find without the direct interaction with the community at large with the exception of planting the evidence.  
</p>
<p>  
    The second stage of maturity would allow conscious users of information and documenting evidence chains of memetic knowledge which have reached maturity so as to be encapsulated and brought into being by a response in the present day by later generations who due to the progress of technology seek greater anonymity than the current  or past climate of social isolation dictated for us.
